### Bash Scripts Collection

A professional collection of Bash scripts for Linux/Unix system administration, monitoring, and automation tasks. This project showcases practical skills in shell scripting and foundational knowledge of DevOps practices.

---

### Project Features

This repository includes a variety of scripts organized into two tiers:

- **Basic Scripts**: Simple, single-purpose utilities for file management, system information, and everyday tasks.
    
- **Intermediate Scripts**: More complex scripts for system monitoring, automated backups, and network diagnostics, demonstrating a deeper understanding of system administration.
    

---

### Key Highlights

- **Modular and Organized Code**: The project is structured with clear, logical directories (`Basic`, `Intermediate`) and shared function files (`common_functions.sh`), promoting code reusability and maintainability.
    
- **Best Practices**: Scripts include robust error handling (`set -euo pipefail`), clear shebangs (`#!/bin/bash`), and a consistent coding style.
    
- **Configuration Management**: Scripts use external configuration files (`default.conf`) for easy customization of settings like alert thresholds.
    
- **Automation Focus**: Demonstrates the ability to create scripts for automating routine tasks like backups and system health checks, a core skill for any DevOps role.
    
- **Clear Documentation**: Each script has a header explaining its purpose, usage, and features. The README provides a comprehensive overview of the entire project.
